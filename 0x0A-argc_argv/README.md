The name of the variable argc stands for "argument count"; argc contains the number of arguments passed to the program. The name of the variable argv stands for "argument vector". A vector is a one-dimensional array, and argv is a one-dimensional array of strings. Each string is one of the arguments that was passed to the program.

For example, the command line

gcc -o myprog myprog.c
would result in the following values internal to GCC:


argc
4
argv[0]
gcc
argv[1]
-o
argv[2]
myprog
argv[3]
myprog.c
As you can see, the first argument (argv[0]) is the name by which the program was called, in this case gcc. Thus, there will always be at least one argument to a program, and argc will always be at least 1.
